Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS

Try experimenting with the DukeLearnToProgram (DLTP) JavaScript programming environment to get comfortable with beginning to write JavaScript!
Here is a link to the environment: http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course1/example/index.php

Program 1:
Write a JavaScript program that modifies an image by putting three vertical stripes on it - a red stripe on the left one third, a green stripe in the middle, and a blue stripe on the right one third.
For example, if your program ran on Drewâ€™s picture shown on the left, the resulting image would have red, green and blue vertical stripes as shown in the image on the right.

Program 2:
Write a JavaScript function named swapRedGreen with one parameter pixel (representing a single pixel). This function should swap the red and green values of the pixel. For example, if you have a pixel with red = 255, green = 100, blue = 150, after calling swapRedGreen on that pixel its new RGB values would be red = 100, green = 255, blue = 150.

Program 3:
Write code to change the Duke blue devil (the image below on the left) to be yellow.


If you are struggling writing your for loop, review the For Loops video. The method values will be critical to writing your loop. Be sure to review the documentation to understand how this method works: http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course1/doc/
